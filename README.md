# Topic Modeling using BERTopic

This was done as my end of graduation project at UFRGS.

It consists of a topic modeling using BERTopic to cluster non labeled information from electronic invoices obtained by SEFAZ-RS, the state treasury office at Rio Grande do Sul (BR).

This was done using two types of databases that cannot be shared, the first being one refined by a markov chain that grouped products that relate to milk and meat, while the second was not done any refinement.

It was evaluated and was given the maximum grade possible.
